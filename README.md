# souper

A 5+5 (up to 10 oscillator) "super-saw" wave oscillator for your KORG Miniloge XD / Prologue synthesizers.

# As always, especially with the KORG user oscillators, these are to be used at your own risk!


### A quick word...
I've been having a ton of fun creating these plugins, and it's thirsty work. If you like stuff like this and my other work, by all means feel free to contribute whatever you can to the fund to help fund the beer supply!

### installation

Ensure you have the KORG minilogue/prologue sound librarian installed. Now, before you do anything else, **perform a full and complete backup of your synthesizer and save this to disk before continuing**. See the sound librarian manual for instructions on how to do this if required.

Next, select the USER OSCILLATORS tab on the librarian, and drag and drop the requisite file to an available slot in the librarian :
 - for Minilogue xd users, please use souper.mnlgxdunit
 - for Prologue users, please use souper.prlgunit

You should now see Souper V1.00-1 listed in your user oscillators. Press "Send All" under USER OSC / FX to send all of your user oscillator / effects to your synthesizer

*please note if you do not do this correctly you may run the risk of losing data. As always, backup, backup, backup!*

### usage

Souper generates 5 sawtooth waveforms (as of version 1.00-1), where 4 can be detuned from the root first sawtooth via the Shape knob. Note, when Shape is set to 0 (full left), the waveforms are not out of tune, and are locked, which can be used to generate wave-table-esqe type sounds, as while these oscillators are locked, they are also allowed to free-run enabling this effect.

You can also add a second set of 5 sawtooth waveforms, who's level is set via the Shift+Shape knob. This second set by default are one octave above the main waveform, however this can be adjusted in the Multi Engine parameters - Parameter 1, "Second Note" allows you to change which relative note this second group is playing (1 : Octave up (default), 5'th, 4'th, Root (uses slightly different detuning), 5'th down, 4'th down, lower octave, lower 4'th and 2x lower octave).
